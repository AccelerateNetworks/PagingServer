[audio]

;; klaxon: paging tone to play for callers.
;;  Can be left empty (default) to have none.
;;  If sample path is not *.wav, it will be converted with ffmpeg (to wav in temp-dir).
; klaxon = /etc/paging.wav

;; klaxon-max-length: simple sanity-check limit on klaxon length (in seconds).
;;  This is NOT the "length of an audio file" option, and does not need to be touched at all.
;;  Should likely only be used when something goes wrong and server does not pick up the calls.
;;  Default is 10s.
; klaxon-max-length = 5.56

;; klaxon-padding: Delay (seconds) after klaxon sound finishes playing and call gets picked-up.
;;  Can be negative to pick up the call before klaxon finishes playing.
;;  Default is no delay (0s).
; klaxon-padding = 1.0

;; pjsua-device: regexp to pick pjsua output device by name.
;;  Will raise error on >1 match. Numeric id can be used instead.
;;  Use --dump-pjsua-devices cli option to see all devices available.
;;  Default is to use "pulse" device, which should be alsa pulse plugin.
; pjsua-device = ^pulse$

;; pjsua-conf-port: regexp to pick pjsua output conference port by name.
;;  Will raise error on >1 match. Numeric id can be used instead.
;;  Use --dump-pjsua-conf-ports cli option to see all ports available.
;;  Default is to use any available port, will signal error if there's more than one.
; pjsua-conf-port =

;; pulse-match: regexp for pulse sink inputs to consider to be music players.
;;  These will be muted when during calls and unmuted afterwards (and on restart).
;;  All sink properties will be matched against this regexp, one-by-one, stopping on first match.
;;  Default is: ^application\.process\.binary=mpd$
; pulse-match = ^application\.process\.binary=mpd$

;; volume-*: volume levels to set for audio streams, in percent of the full volume.
;;  Should typically be a value in 0-100 range (floats will work too),
;;   with values >100 meaning software-boosted volume, which can negatively affect audio quality.
;;  Zero (0) will mute the stream.
;;  Negative value (e.g. -1) will leave volume level untouched, i.e. up to pulse and/or player.
;;  Default is -1 (don't set volume level) for all of these options.
; volume-music = 27.5
; volume-klaxon = 50
; volume-call = 65.0

;; music-fade-*-duration: duration in seconds for fade-in/fade-out
;;   for music streams (matched by "pulse-match" regexp) after/before calls.
;;  Zero (0) or negative value (e.g. -1) will disable fade-in/fade-out effects.
;;  Default is 3s for fade-out, 10s for fade-in.
;; music-fade-*-offset: time offset (in seconds) for fade-in/fade-out to start/end.
;;  Zero (0) means no offset, i.e. fade-out
;;   ends when klaxon starts, and fade-in starts right after call ends.
;;  Can be negative for fade-out, so it'd end before klaxon starts.
;;  Default is 0 (no offset) for both fade-in/fade-out.
;; music-fade-*-min: min volume level for fade-in/fade-out.
;;  Same format/meaning as with volume-* values (see above).
;;  I.e. what fade-in starts from or fade-out "fades to", set right before/after mute/unmute.
;;  Default is 0 - fade from/to complete silence.
; music-fade-in-duration = 5.15
; music-fade-in-offset = -0.5
; music-fade-in-min = 12.4
; music-fade-out-duration = 3.5
; music-fade-out-offset = 1.4
; music-fade-out-min = 5


[calls]

;; hang-up-after-minutes: duration (from picking it up) after which to hang up calls, in minutes.
;;  Can have a fractional part, e.g. "0.5" for 30s.
;;  Default is 5 minutes.
; hang-up-after-minutes = 10

;; hold-concurrent: whether to hold concurrent calls or put them all into same conference slot (yes/no).
;;  Default is "no" - to put all callers into same conference slot.
; hold-concurrent = yes


[server]

;; debug: verbose operation mode.
; debug = no

;; pjsua-log-level: pjsua lib logging level.
;;  Only used if debug is enabled.
;;  Zero is only for fatal errors, higher levels are more noisy.
; pjsua-log-level = 0

;; sentry_dsn: use specified Sentry instance  to capture errors/logging using "raven" module.
; sentry_dsn = https://0b915e29784f479f93db6ae2870515b6:b2fb7becafdc4c259b813a8f84f5b855@sentry.finn.io/2
