[audio]

;; klaxon: paging tone to play for callers.
;;  Can be left empty (default) to have none.
;;  If sample path is not *.wav, it will be converted with ffmpeg (to wav in temp-dir).
; klaxon = /etc/paging.wav

;; klaxon-max-length: simple sanity-check limit on klaxon length (in seconds).
;;  This is NOT the "length of an audio file" option, and does not need to be touched at all.
;;  Should likely only be used when something goes wrong and server does not pick up the calls.
;;  Default is 10s.
; klaxon-max-length = 5.56

;; klaxon-padding: Delay (seconds) after klaxon sound finishes playing and call gets picked-up.
;;  Can be negative to pick up the call before klaxon finishes playing.
;;  Default is no delay (0s).
; klaxon-padding = 1.0

;; pulse-mute: regexp for pulse sink inputs to consider to be music players.
;;  These will be muted when during calls and unmuted afterwards (and on restart).
;;  All sink properties will be matched against this regexp, one-by-one, stopping on first match.
;;  Default is: ^application\.process\.binary=mpd$
; pulse-mute = ^application\.process\.binary=mpd$

;; pjsua-device: regexp to pick pjsua output device by name.
;;  Will raise error on >1 match. Numeric id can be used instead.
;;  Use --dump-pjsua-devices cli option to see all devices available.
;;  Default is to use "pulse" device, which should be alsa pulse plugin.
; pjsua-device = ^pulse$

;; pjsua-conf-port: regexp to pick pjsua output conference port by name.
;;  Will raise error on >1 match. Numeric id can be used instead.
;;  Use --dump-pjsua-conf-ports cli option to see all ports available.
;;  Default is to use any available port, will signal error if there's more than one.
; pjsua-conf-port =


[calls]

;; hang-up-after-minutes: duration (from picking it up) after which to hang up calls, in minutes.
;;  Can have a fractional part, e.g. "0.5" for 30s.
;;  Default is 5 minutes.
; hang-up-after-minutes = 10

;; hold-concurrent: whether to hold concurrent calls or put them all into same conference slot (yes/no).
;;  Default is "no" - to put all callers into same conference slot.
; hold-concurrent = yes


[server]

;; debug: verbose operation mode.
; debug = no

;; pjsua-log-level: pjsua lib logging level.
;;  Only used if debug is enabled.
;;  Zero is only for fatal errors, higher levels are more noisy.
; pjsua-log-level = 0

;; sentry_dsn: use specified Sentry instance  to capture errors/logging using "raven" module.
; sentry_dsn = https://0b915e29784f479f93db6ae2870515b6:b2fb7becafdc4c259b813a8f84f5b855@sentry.finn.io/2
